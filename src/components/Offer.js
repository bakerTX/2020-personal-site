        I decided to start offering my websites to the world. My dream is to build websites for people and to make a living from it. Right now, I specialize in creating lightweight, portable, and quickly deployed websites for individuals and
        {' '}
        <em>small</em>
        {' '}
        businesses. ðŸ˜€
        <br />
        My favorite websites are hand-made and made with care. While I won&#39;t be able to build the next world class Amazon competitor website for you, I can offer a solid and reponsive site - customized to your preferences. Your new site will be fast to load and accessible from anywhere.
        <br />
